# Markdown Notes Application

A full-stack Markdown Notes Application built using **React.js, Node.js (Express), and SQLite**.
The app allows users to create, edit, delete, and preview notes in real time using Markdown syntax with automatic persistence.

This project was developed as part of an **SDE Fresher Assignment** to demonstrate clean architecture, REST API design, database integration, and frontend usability.

## 🧠 Engineering Decisions

### Why SQLite?

SQLite was chosen because:

* lightweight
* zero configuration
* ideal for local persistence
* suitable for assignment-level projects

---

### Why Debounced Auto-Save?

Auto-save improves UX and prevents excessive API calls by saving only after typing stops for a short duration.

This demonstrates performance-aware frontend design.

---

### Why Component Separation?

The UI is split into:

* NotesList
* Editor
* Preview

This improves:

* readability
* maintainability
* scalability

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application supports:

* Desktop split-screen editor
* Tablet stacked layout
* Mobile vertical layout

---

## 🌙 Dark Mode

Users can toggle between light and dark themes using the sidebar switch.
Theme preference updates instantly across the UI.

---

## 🔍 Search Functionality

Users can search notes by:

* title
* content

Filtering updates in real time.
